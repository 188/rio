Since v0.2.8 Rio terminal has been releasing with GoReleaser, which simplifies my life. Before, I had the process of release partially manually (Apple MacOS notarization) and the rest automated. In the automation side, I didn't have support to `.rpm` files and had to update few files regarding the new version. Frankly, it's the kind of work I don't want to do for every release.

GoReleaser is a release automation tool. It currently supports Go, Rust, Zig, and TypeScript (with Bun and Deno). GoReleaser was created to solve a problem we all had at some point: releasing software is boring and error prone.

Rio wouldn't be using GoReleaser without the awesome work from [Vedant Mohan Goyal](https://github.com/vedantmgoyal9) and [Carlos Becker](https://github.com/caarlos0). Talking which, Vedant is writing a blog post migrating Rio pipeline to GoReleaser, seriously go follow him!

That's it for today folks :)
