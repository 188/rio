Since v0.2.8 Rio terminal has been releasing with GoReleaser, which makes my life much simple. Before I was doing the process of release manually (specially Apple MacOS notarization).

GoReleaser is a release automation tool. It currently supports Go, Rust, Zig, and TypeScript (with Bun and Deno). GoReleaser was created to solve a problem we all had at some point: releasing software is boring and error prone.

Rio wouldn't be using GoReleaser if wasn't the awesome work from [Vedant Mohan Goyal](https://github.com/vedantmgoyal9) and [Carlos Becker](https://github.com/caarlos0). Talking which, Vedant is writing a blog post migrating Rio pipeline to GoReleaser, seriously go follow him!

That's it for today folks :)
